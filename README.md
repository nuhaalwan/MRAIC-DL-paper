MATLAB code for paper: Model reference adaptive inverse control of nonlinear systems: a deep learning approach
This repository contains the code for the paper: "Model reference adaptive inverse control of nonlinear systems: a deep learning approach" which is currently under revison at Journal of Umm Al-qura University for Engineering and Architecture. This code is provided to support the review process and ensure reproducibility. 
The two .m files produce Figures 11 and 12. All other figures can be obtained by simple modifications of the code in accordance with the paper.
